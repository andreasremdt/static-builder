# static-builder

This project is still in (alpha) development and not yet ready for usage.

_static-builder_ will be a tool similar to Jekyll or Hexo: to build static websites. It'll be super simple and as fast as possible.

## Work in progress

- ~~Compile HTML using Nunjucks templates~~
  - ~~Use partials and layouts~~
- ~~Create pages using either Markdown or HTML files~~
- Create collections, e. g. for blogs or other data (Markdown or YAML)
- Create an API (CLI) for usage
- Make configurable
